\noindent Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for
writers palliate the writer's loneliness, but I doubt if they improve
his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and
often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a
good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.

\begin{preface}
Almost nothing is said in the manual about the preface. There is no
indication about how it is to be typeset. Given that, one is forced to
simply typeset it and hope it is accepted. It is, however, optional
and may be omitted.

This dissertation would not have been possible without the help and support of my family, friends, colleagues and mentors. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them. 


First, I would like to thank Prof. Sujit Dey for patience to train me to think and write with clarity. This has helped me not only in my research and technical writing, but also in other aspects of my life. 

My parents have been the cornerstone of my education and career through their unconditional and selfless support. I would like to thank them for being extremely patient even though they didnâ€™t always understand my opinions and decisions. This achievement is as much mine as it is theirs. 

I would also like to thank Sandeep Bhatkar, Michael Hart, Vijay Mahadevan, Nikhil Rasiwasia, Gaurav Aggarwal for mentoring me during internships. My internships have facilitated a good chunk of my learning and the contribution of my mentors has been significant. I would like to thank Nitesh Shroff for doubling up as a friend and mentor when I needed the help. 

Graduate school has been a fun and learning experience for me. I would like to thank my friends Kritika, Bharathan, Rishi, Manish, Ravee, Sumit, and many others for making the journey enjoyable. It would have been much less exciting if I did not have them to pour my heart out. My labmates especially Yao, Jason, Po-Han, Ranjini, Ali have also been helpful in keeping my sanity over the past six years.  

Lastly, I would also like to thank my friends from IIT Madras. They have been my constant support and have somehow been able to understand what I have intended to say. 

Chapter 2, in full, is a reprint of the material as it appears in
Numerical Grid Generational in Computational Fluid Mechanics~2009.
Smith, Laura; Smith, Jane~D., Pineridge Press,~2009. The dissertation
author was the primary investigator and author of this paper.

Chapter 3, in part, has been submitted for publication of the material
as it may appear in Education Mechanics,~2009, Smith, Laura; Smith,
Jane~D., Trailor Press,~2009. The dissertation author was the primary
investigator and author of this paper.

Chapter 5, in part is currently being prepared for submission for
publication of the material. Smith, Laura; Smith, Jane~D\@. The
dissertation author was the primary investigator and author of this
material.

% Put your maximum 350 word abstract here.
\begin{dissertationabstract}
The Abstract begins here. The abstract is limited to 350 words for a
doctoral dissertation. It should consist of a short statement of the
problem, a brief explanation of the methods and procedures employed in
generating the data, and a condensed summary of the findings of the
study. The abstract may continute onto a second page if necessary. The
text of the abstract must be double spaced.

% Optional Introduction
\begin{dissertationintroduction}
This optional section is barely described in the OGS manual other than
saying it is optional and that it appears in the table of contents
between the Abstract and the first chapter.

No formatting guidelines appear so presumably, it should be formatted
like an ordinary chapter. It should appear after the
\verb!\mainmatter! macro because it should start on page~1.
