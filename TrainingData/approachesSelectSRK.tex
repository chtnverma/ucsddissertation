\section{Approaches to select SRKs}
\label{sec:selectionSRK}

In order to obtain SRKs from a set of valid keywords, we propose two efficient approaches. The first approach (LCPD) is based on defining a diversity score per keyword. By defining a linear combination of the proximity and diversity scores of keywords, we propose an iterative algorithm to select SRKs one by one. Such an approach leads to high accuracy in video classification based on varying a parameter that controls the relative importance given to the two objective functions, namely proximity score and diversity score of a selected keyword. However, since the best parameter value cannot be known beforehand, and is different for different sets of categories, we also propose an annealing based alternating optimization (AAO) approach. In the AAO approach, we utilize two iterative algorithms that optimize for either objective function and we combine them in a simulated annealing framework. In order to facilitate the second approach, we define diversity for a set of keywords. Such an approach doesn't need preferences to be embedded in form of parameters, however as compared to the first approach, it may suffer some performance loss.
